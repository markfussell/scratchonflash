/**
 * The Media Package has classes for dealing with
 * sound, image, filters (effects), etc.
 * 
 * Most of this was in the Scratch-Objects category, but media
 * is very different between platform implementations and the
 * Sprite/Morph core objects are very similar, so 
 * I split the two apart.
 * 
 * I also moved 'Scratch-Sound' into here.
